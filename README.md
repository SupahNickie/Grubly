Grubly
======

Local boutique restaurants oftentimes face challenges that larger established eateries wouldn't have to place such importance on, such as inventory management. A consumer oftentimes may thusly arrive at an in-demand restaurant and not even be allowed to order because of a shortage. This issue is especially important to certain types of restaurants more so than others, such as BBQ places, who routinely have to marinade, smoke, and precook the correct amounts of food each day, sometimes by feel alone. Grubly is an app that allows consumers to check (in realtime) inventories of food items at local restaurants, as well as be able to place orders.
